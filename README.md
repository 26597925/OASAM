# OASAM

**OASAM** is the acronym of **O**pen **A**ndroid **S**ecurity **A**ssessment **M**ethodology and its purpose is to become a reference framework on Android application vulnerability assessments.


Portable devices are currently holding the market and consumerization is leading them to business applications, invalidating the obsolete idea of using them strictly for leisure activities. Furthermore, Android is emerging as the most extended operating system in this aspect due to various reasons, including the ease of use and massive distribution of applications. However, in terms of security, no information related with the new vulnerabilities that could lead to an insecure programming on this platform is being disclosed, knowing that this platform has a notable attack surface (the traditional one plus the Androidâ€™s own architecture).

On the other hand, despite there are particular works in this respect, a complete and consistent taxonomy of vulnerabilities on specific Android applications that allows cataloguing such vulnerabilitiesdoes not exist.

The OASAM Project purpose is to elaborate a complete and consistent taxonomy of vulnerabilities on Android applications, supporting not only application developers, but also people in charge of looking for vulnerabilities in them
